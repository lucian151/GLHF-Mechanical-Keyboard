# GLHF-Mechanical-Keyboard
The GLHF was made by Lucian Chapar and Gabriel Seltzer with assistance from the /r/mechanicalkeyboard internet community. 

This project started with Lucian telling Gabe how he wanted to make a compact 96-key. As they set out to make it, they realized they could further minimize the layout into what you now see here! 

This keyboard is still a WIP - we're in the midst of hand wiring a first prototype now. We hope to eventually produce a small run of PCBs to distribute on Tindie, but we aren't quite there yet. Stay tuned for updates!
